# CS-499 Capstone ePortfolio  
## Chorsie Martin III

This repository contains my CS-499 Capstone ePortfolio. It showcases the original version of my application, the enhanced version, supporting documentation, and a code review video that explains the improvements I made and how they align with program outcomes.

The goal of this portfolio is to demonstrate my growth throughout the computer science program and my ability to design, improve, and communicate a complete software solution.

## 🌐 Live ePortfolio Website

You can view the full portfolio here:

The site provides organized access to all required materials.

## 📁 Contents of This Repository

### ⭐ Professional Self-Assessment

This document reflects on my development as a computing professional, the skills I gained throughout the program, and how my work meets the program outcomes.

📄 Folder: `Professional_Assessment/`

### ⭐ Milestone Narratives

These documents describe the enhancement process across each milestone and explain the technical decisions behind the improvements.

📄 Folder: `Narratives/`

Includes:

- Enhancement One — Software Design & Engineering  
- Enhancement Two — Algorithms & Data Structures  
- Enhancement Three — Databases  

### ⭐ Original Artifacts

This folder contains the original version of my application before enhancements were applied.

📁 Folder: `Original_Artifacts/`

The full source code is included. Static preview pages are provided where possible.

### ⭐ Enhanced Artifacts

This folder contains the improved version of the application demonstrating better structure, maintainability, and overall software engineering practices.

📁 Folder: `Enhanced_Artifacts/`

Enhancements include:

- Modular project organization  
- Separation of concerns (routes, services, models, views)  
- Improved data handling  
- Cleaner architecture  
- More maintainable code  

The complete enhanced source code is included along with static preview pages.

### ⭐ Code Review Video

This video walks through both the original and enhanced artifacts, explains the improvements I made, and discusses the technical concepts behind those changes.

## ⚠️ Important Note About Functionality

This application uses a Node.js/Express backend.

GitHub Pages only hosts static content, so server-side features such as routing, database operations, and APIs do not run on the live site. The full functionality can be observed when the application is run locally.

## 🛠️ Running the Enhanced Application Locally

To run the enhanced version of the project:

1. Install Node.js  
2. Clone this repository  
3. Open a terminal and navigate to:


cd Enhanced_Artifacts


4. Install dependencies:


npm install


5. Start the server:


npm start


6. Open a browser and go to:


http://localhost:3000

## 🎯 Program Outcomes Demonstrated

This capstone project demonstrates my ability to:

- Design and evaluate computing solutions  
- Apply algorithmic thinking and software engineering principles  
- Use modern tools and technologies effectively  
- Communicate technical ideas clearly  
- Improve an existing system through structured enhancements  
- Consider security and maintainability in software design
